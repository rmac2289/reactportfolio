    aboutMe1: `I'm a native East Coaster, ex-Midwesterner, and current West Coaster in the midst of a relocation
    to the Portland, OR metro area. I'm coming to the end of an apprenticeship with Bloc.io/Thinkful
    and I'm passionate about entering the field of web development. For the last three years I've worked
    as a 9-1-1 dispatcher - an extremely rewarding career path, but also hectic at times. I felt that career-wise something was missing,
    and I began to search for ways to learn how to code. I taught myself as much as I could on my own before getting into a structured program. 
    The prospect of constantly learning new techniques, methods, and technologies for the
    rest of my career is exciting - the field seems to contain limitless opportunities
    to learn new things and gain new skills.`,
    aboutMe2: `Outside of web development,
    I enjoy spending my time helping others and spending as much time as possible outside. I strongly
    believe a rewarding life is built on experiences - I love visiting new places and discovering the
    unfamiliar things that life has to offer.`,

    experience1: `My most significant experience in the field of web/software development is through my apprenticeship
    with Bloc/Thinkful. Through a mix of learning modules, creating live web apps, one-on-one sessions with an experience mentor,
    and mock technical interviews I've gained the experience necessary to contribute to any team. I have several apps that I've built
    from start to finish that are currently live - they can be found through the projects link above.`,
    experience2: `Through my 9-1-1 career I've learned to quickly make decisions,
    take control of situations, lead effectively, communicate with team members, and deal with a highly
    stressful work environment. The job is essentially a continuous string of high-priority short-term
    deadlines that have to be met. All of this is done while efficiently manipulating multiple software
    systems.`,
