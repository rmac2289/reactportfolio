    aboutMe1: `I'm a native East Coaster, ex-Midwesterner, and current West Coaster. I'm a current student in the
    web development track at Bloc
    and I'm passionate about entering the field of web development. The prospect of
    constantly learning new techniques, methods, and technologies for the
    rest of my career is exciting - doing the same things over and over again is not my idea of
    a fulfilling career.`,
    aboutMe2: `Outside of web development,
    I enjoy spending my time helping others and spending as much time as possible outside. I strongly
    believe a rewarding life is built on experiences - I love visiting new places and discovering the
    unfamiliar things that life has to offer.`,
    experience1: `My most significant career experience to this point has been in the field of 9-1-1 Emergency
    Dispatch.
    I am able to quickly make decisions,
    take control of situations, lead effectively, communicate with team members, and deal with a highly
    stressful work environment. The job is essentially a continuous string of high-priority short-term
    deadlines that have to be met. All of this is done while efficiently manipulating multiple software
    systems.
    In addition, the people skills I have built through speaking with both citizens and public safety
    employees will
    be valuable moving forward.`,
    experience2: `Technically speaking - I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library. I am
    continuing to learn new methods and languages daily - I am highly adaptable and I learn quickly. I
    believe
    I could be an asset on any web development team; reach out to me via my contact links below.`
